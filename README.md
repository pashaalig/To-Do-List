# To-Do-List
A To-Do list is a list that we can keep to put all the task. It can be very useful
for managing time, by planning your day ahead of time and prioritizing 
activities. I have created a basic To-Do application using Django framework. In
this application, we can add items to the list by clicking a button, delete and edit 
items from the list.
